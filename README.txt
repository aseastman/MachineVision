This repository is for Machine Vision examples. 

I have started using OpenCV, so the current examples all utilize that module in Python. 

Trial_Code:
- A very simple code to read in a designated picture (currently "test_pic.jpg") and display it in greyscale. 

Digits_learning:
- Uses OpenCV's kNN algorithm to predict digits from 0 to 9. This is based on an example from:
http://opencv-python-tutroals.readthedocs.org/en/latest/py_tutorials/py_ml/py_knn/py_knn_opencv/py_knn_opencv.html#knn-opencv
with a few modifications to reduce the lines of code and have it try different k-values.
